This repository is under construction and contain the following subfolders:
- **Matlab**, code for reproducing figures in matlab.
- **Models**, the small and extended model in Matlabs Simbiology format. Five different parameter sets that fit data will be included.
- **Posterior distribution**, the sampled parameter set fitting the experimental data. 
- **R**, the modified ABC code for the AKAP79-PKA model in R.
- **Targets**, the experimental wilde type data used for model calibration as well as the experimental data from the mutation experiments.
