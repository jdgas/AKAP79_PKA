This repository is under construction and will contain the following subfolders:
- **Experimental data**, the experimental wilde type data used for model calibration as well as the experimental data from the mutation experiments.
- **Models**, the small and extended model in Matlabs Simbiology format. Five different parameter sets that fit data will be included. 
- **Posterior distribution**, the sampled parameter set fitting the experimental data.
- **Supplementary figures**, i) modelling of responses at different cAMP levels ii) illustration of five different parameter sets.
- **UQ-AKAP79**, the modified ABC code for the AKAP79-PKA model in R.
- **Figure reproduction**, code for reproducing figures in matlab.
